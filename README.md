### Session One

*Today's date*: 24th Jan, 2023

- Recorder: Basil
- Facilitator: Sarah
- Timekeeper: Abdi

#### Round One: Sentences
 
- Abdi: "Continuous Automated testing integrated into the development teams tightens the feedback loop between the time a defect is inserted and time it's detected, contributing to lower-cost defect correctinos and a strong focus on intiial code quality."
  - Why this sentence is important?
  - This sentence is significant because it emphasises the value of ongoing automated testing as a component of the development process. Automation of testing improves code quality by finding and fixing errors more rapidly. Automated testing also closes the feedback loop between the time a flaw is introduced and the time it is discovered, assisting in the speedy detection and resolution of any problems. In the end, this aids in ensuring the best quality of code, which is crucial for effective software development. This helps in being a better developer overall.
  
- Sarah: "A key difference between OODA and the Sequential approach is that OODA [Agile] focuses on observing the environment and reacting to it whereas Sequential focuses on controlling the environment."
  - Why this sentence is important?
  - Agile methodologies like Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act (OODA) place a strong emphasis on adaptability. For instance, in a corporate setting, this strategy focuses on evaluating the current conditions of the business environment, orienting the individual or organisation to the conditions, choosing the optimal course of action, and ultimately taking that course of action. This contrasts with a sequential strategy, in which the emphasis is on managing the environment and following planned stages to arrive at a predetermined result.
Being adaptable is crucial for organisations to stay successful and preserve a competitive advantage in today's environment of fast change. With this strategy, businesses may make more informed decisions that more accurately reflect the environment and keep them competitive in their particular industries.
  
- Basil: "Once you move beyond the thinking that "Agile" is an indivisible concept that must be applied all-or-nothing, you become free to adopt Agile practices individually"
  - Why this sentence is important?
  - This sentence is significant because it emphasises how Agile is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. It is a collection of techniques that can be adapted and used in many situations and settings to provide the greatest outcomes. Agile practises can be implemented incrementally, which provides for greater awareness of each practise as well as greater adaptability when it comes to handling alterations in needs or unforeseen difficulties. It is a more adaptable strategy that can deliver better long-term benefits and is better equipped to adjust to changing conditions.

- Sarah: "We have seen Agile implementations fail because organizations are not aligned on what they mean by "Agile.""
  - Why this sentence is important?
  - This sentence is significant because it identifies one of the main reasons why Agile implementations frequently fail to succeed in organisations. Agile is a method of working that is built on teamwork, communication, and ongoing learning. When businesses are not in agreement with these key concepts, they may find it difficult to get the intended results. Organizations can make sure they are able to fully benefit from Agile and take advantage of its many advantages by knowing how crucial team alignment is.

- Basil: *"This book is not about how to do Agile correctly - it's about how to get the most value from the Agile practices that makes sense for your business."*
  - Why the sentence is important?
  - This sentence is important because it highlights the notion that each company should adapt the Agile techniques to meet its own needs and objectives. This phrase encourages businesses to concentrate on what works for them rather than trying to adhere to a standard set of Agile principles that may not be the most beneficial for their particular scenario by highlighting the need for customization and personalization. This line highlights the significance of getting the maximum value possible through Agile techniques, which is the ultimate objective.

- Christian: "Where sequential approaches fail in bureaucracy, agile approaches fail in anarchy."
  - Why this sentence is important?
  - While initially it looks like the agile approach would come along with anarchy, with how it mixes every part of development together, and with a focus on getting to a deployable state every few weeks, this is not the case. Agile thrives on consistent high discipline practices like the daily standup, and keeping up with each of the meetings from backlog refinement, to sprint planning, to sprint retrospective, each of these are key parts of scrum, that take effort to uphold, and uphold properly, its when these activities fail that you lose the efficacy of agile, because youre no longer able to track your progress, and you lose your direction towards the end goals of the sprint
  
#### Round Two: words

- Abdi: "Cyenefin"
  - Meaning (in this context): The Cynefin framework is a conceptual framework used to aid decision-making. Created in 1999 by Dave Snowden when he worked for IBM Global Services.
  - Origin: Cynefin, pronounced kuh-nev-in, is a Welsh word meaning “haunt”, “habitat”, “acquainted”, “accustomed”, “familiar”.
  - Explanation and Desicussion: The group found the word needed more explaining and discussed the origin of the word and how it ties with agile and the whole idea in general
  
- Basil: "Scrum"
  - Meaning (in this context): Scrum is an agile project management framework
  - Origin: Scrum comes Rugby, which means "teamwork"
- Sarah: "Agile"
  - Meaning (in this context): The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases
  - Origin:  the term “Agile” was brought into being in early 2001 by a group of software developers trying to identify an alternative to the lengthy documentation-driven software development methods
  
- Christian: "OODA"(Observe Orient Decide Act)
  - Meaning (in this context): Decision making framework designed to improve the decision making process in a variety of scenarios, allowing for well informed, well justified decisions to be made in an intense, fast paced environment


#### Round Three: Impact

- Q. In what way will the things you read this week impact your software development practice?
  - Basil: The readings this week has given me insightful information on efficient project management and software development teams. It has improved my comprehension of the ideas and provided knowledge on how to manage teams successfully. I have gained knowledge on the value of goal-setting, communication, and problem-solving through the readings. In general, the readings this week have been really helpful in helping me comprehend the various facets of project management. I am now well-equipped to create strategies for productive software developmen.
  - Sarah: This week's readings has allowed me to understand how a good project or software development team management strategy can now be developed. I now know how to define objectives, lead motivated, well-organized teams, and recognise and resolve problems as they arise. Additionally, the readings have improved my knowledge of team dynamics, work delegation, and peer collaboration.
  - Abdi: This week's readings enables me to gain skills in agile principles that work with my traits hence making me a better developer overall.
  - Christian: This week's readings has given me a much better idea of what the importance of agile is, as well as the scenarios where it fits, its emphasized that agile is not a one-size-fits-all solution, there are still scenarios where sequential development is preferred, and it is also outlined where the strengths of each are, and how to classify your projects between an agile approach, or a sequential approach, so that in the future I can make sure to tailor my processes to whatever project I am working on, allowing me to consistently bring the right approach, and mindset, to a project.
- Q. Is there a theme?
  - The phrases and sentences discussed throughout the session do, in fact, have a common topic. The emphasis of the theme is on the value of ***adaptability*** and agility in both software development and decision-making. All of the acronyms mentioned—Cynefin, Scrum, Agile, and OODA, for example—emphasize how crucial it is for organisations and teams to be able to adapt rapidly and effectively to their environment. The examples show how it's important to pay attention to the surroundings, get familiar with them, choose the best course of action, and move quickly. In today's competitive environment, this idea of agility and flexibility is crucial for any organisation to succeed.
