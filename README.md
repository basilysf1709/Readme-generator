### Session One

*Today's date*

- Recorder: Basil
- Facilitator: Sarah
- Timekeeper: Abdi

#### Round One: Sentences

- Basil: *"This book is not about how to do Agile correctly - it's about how to get the most value from the Agile practices that makes sense for your business."*
  - Why the sentence is important?
  - This sentence is important because it highlights the notion that each company should adapt the Agile techniques to meet its own needs and objectives. This phrase encourages businesses to concentrate on what works for them rather than trying to adhere to a standard set of Agile principles that may not be the most beneficial for their particular scenario by highlighting the need for customization and personalization. This line highlights the significance of getting the maximum value possible through Agile techniques, which is the ultimate objective.
 
- Basil: "Once you move beyond the thinking that "Agile" is an indivisible concept that must be applied all-or-nothing, you become free to adopt Agile practices individually"
- Sarah: "A key difference between OODA and the Sequential approach is that OODA [Agile] focuses on observing the environment and reacting to it whereas Sequential focuses on controlling the environment."
- Sarah: "We have seen Agile implementations fail because organizations are not aligned on what they mean by "Agile.""
- Christian: "Where sequential approaches fail in bureaucracy, agile approaches fail in anarchy."
